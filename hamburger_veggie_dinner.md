### Directions

1. Heat a very large pan, electric fry pan or large heavy-bottomed pot. Add the minced beef in several chunks, and heat, stirring frequently to break it up. Add the chopped onion and garlic and keep stirring, over high heat, until the onion is transparent.  
1. Add the sliced celery and carrots, then the soup, hot water, oregano and basil. Mix together and allow the mixture to return to the boil.  
1. Add the pasta and mix to combine. Reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so, or until the pasta is fairly tender. (If you think the mixture is too dry add another 1/2 cup of water). Stir in the green peas, broccoli and mushrooms and cook for another 5 minutes, or until these are just tender.  
1. Serve topped with some chopped fresh parsley and a little grated Parmesan, if you like.
