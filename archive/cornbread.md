### Directions

1. First, put about 1 tablespoon of oil or shortening in a skillet. If you have 
bacon drippings, add a little to the skillet for even more flavor. Heat the 
oven to 400F and place the skillet in the oven to preheat.
1. In the large bowl, combine 2 1/2 cups of white cornmeal with 1 cup of 
all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of salt, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. Using a wooden spoon or whisk, stir to blend 
the ingredients.
1. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup of buttermilk, 1 cup of low-fat or whole milk, 
and 2 large eggs. Using the wire whisk or a wooden spoon, whisk or lightly 
beat until blended.
1. Using a whisk or wooden spoon, slowly blend 2 to 3 tablespoons of melted 
butter (or oil) into the milk and egg mixture. If you have bacon drippings, 
add about 1 tablespoon of melted drippings in place of some of the butter.
1. Pour the egg and buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring with a 
wooden spoon just until ingredients are well moistened.
1. Pour batter into heated skillet, bake for 30 to 40 minutes
