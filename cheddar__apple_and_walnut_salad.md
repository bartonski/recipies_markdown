### Directions

1. Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray; heat over medium-high heat. 
Add bacon and cook as package directs until crisp, about 4 minutes; remove bacon to a paper towel. 
Let bacon drain briefly then crumble into bite-size pieces; transfer to a large bowl.
2. Add bread cubes to skillet. Cook over medium heat, tossing often, until slightly golden and 
crisp, about 3 minutes; remove to a plate and set aside. Add walnuts to skillet; cook, tossing 
often until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer walnuts to bowl with bacon.
3. Add spinach, endive, cheese, apple and dressing to bowl; toss to mix and coat.
4. Put about 4 cups of salad mixture on each of 4 plates. Sprinkle each serving with 
about 3 tablespoons of homemade croutons.

Notes

We opted for walnuts and McIntosh apples but feel free to use almonds and any type of apple 
you prefer. The turkey bacon lends a delicious smoky flavor to this meal but if you want 
to make this salad vegetarian, use meatless bacon instead.
