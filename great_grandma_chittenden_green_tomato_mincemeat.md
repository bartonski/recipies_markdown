Note: meat grinder is best for chopping up these ingredients.

One pie takes about 1 1/2 pt. (3 C)

Recipe makes 4 - 4 1/2 qt.

Notes: Less vinegar is probably better: this is pretty tangy stuff.

Preferred pie recipe: Oatmeal-Mincemeat Pie.  It has a nice consistency, and the oatmeal mellows the mincemeat to about the right stage.
