### Directions

1. Preheat your oven to 350.
1. Place your berries in a medium sauce pan and add just enough water to almost cover them. About 2 cups or so.
1. Place the pot over medium high heat and bring to a boil.
1. Add 3/4 cup sugar and stir to dissolve. Turn off the heat and set aside.
1. In a 9x13 baking dish, (I prefer my cast-iron skillet) pour in the melted butter. Set aside.
1. In a medium bowl mix the self rising flour and sugar. Add the milks and stir well. Batter should be slightly thicker than pancake batter.
1. Pour the batter evenly over the melted butter. DO NOT stir.
1. Next use a slotted spoons to sprinkle the hot berries over the batter. Pour over about 2 cups of the remaining water from the berries. Use less water for a more cake-like cobbler and all of the water for a more saucy cobbler.
1. Bake 20-25 minutes until the dough is golden and the cobbler bubbles.
