NOTE: Above is the recipe as I received it in 1965, not the way
I make it.

I use lots of green pepper, but no red.

I usually use a big can of crushed tomatoes in place of the water, and sometimes I use italian sausage as the pork.

I generally use about a tablesppon of salt, and just a few grinds of pepper.
